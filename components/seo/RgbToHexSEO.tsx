        <h2>How the CSS color converter works</h2>
        <p>
          This tool takes an RGB color combination of red, green, and blue values ranging from 0 to 255 and gives you the resulting hexadecimal color code (HEX for short), so you can define colors in HTML and CSS.
          For example, if you're working with Figma designs, this tool allows you to input the RGB color codes from your file, to get the HEX code you would need for html elements.
