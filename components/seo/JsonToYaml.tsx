        <h2>Benefits of Converting JSON documents to YAML</h2>
        <p>
          JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an easy-to-read data format that
          both people and computers can understand. YAML (Ain't Markup Language)
          is a simple file format used for configuration files.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Data Integration:</b> <br /> YAML helps merge data from files
            more easily in web applications and APIs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Data Processing:</b> <br /> YAML is better for converting data in
            different programming languages.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Data Sharing:</b> <br /> YAML's structured format makes it easier
            to share and exchange data between different systems and platforms.

        <h2>JSON vs YAML: Which One to Use?</h2>
        <p>
          When working with configuration files and data serialization, it's
          important to understand the differences between JSON and YAML:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Readability</b> <br />
            JSON is designed for efficient machine parsing, yet remains readable
            for humans. Its structured format allows quick interpretation by
            both computers and developers. YAML prioritizes human readability
            with its clean, indentation-based syntax.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Syntax:</b> <br /> JSON has a stricter syntax with a focus on
            simplicity. YAML syntax supports multi-line strings and complex data
            structures like maps and dictionaries, making it suitable for
            configuration files.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Use Cases:</b> <br /> JSON is widely used in web APIs, data
            interchange, and configuration files for web services. YAML is often
            used in configuration files for applications and Ansible playbooks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Data Types:</b> <br /> Both languages support basic data types
            like strings, numbers, and boolean values. YAML's structured format
            makes it easier to share and exchange data between different systems
            and platforms.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Supported features:</b> <br /> JSON is widely supported in web
            applications and APIs, making it perfect for data interchange. YAML
            supports features like anchors, aliases, and complex data
            structures, making it ideal for configuration files.
