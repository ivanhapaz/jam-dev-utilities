        <h2>How the URL Encoder/Decoder Works</h2>
        <p>
          This URL encoder changes characters to a safe format for transmitting over
          the internet. This ensures that systems can handle special characters,
          spaces, and symbols in web addresses and query strings. For example,
          spaces are converted to %20, and special characters are changed to
          their respective percent-encoded values.
        </p>
        <p>
          Transformed URLs help merge data more efficiently in web applications
          and APIs, ensuring data integrity during processing in different
          programming languages. They facilitate easier data sharing and
          exchange between different systems and platforms by properly handling
          cases where a character is percent encoded. This includes special
          characters, non-ASCII symbols, and spaces. The tool efficiently
          manages query strings and key value pairs, making it ideal for various
          web applications.

        <h2>Debugging Encoded URLs</h2>
        <p>
          Decoded URLs are easier to read and necessary to troubleshoot issues
          or understand how data is being passed through query strings. Decoded
          URLs are essential for debugging because they reveal the actual 
          values being transmitted.
