        <h2>Benefits of Converting CSV to JSON format</h2>
        <p>
          CSV is a simple file format used to store data in tables, like in a
          spreadsheet. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an easy-to-read data
          format that both people and computers can understand.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Data Integration:</b> <br /> JSON helps merge data from CSV files
            more easily in web applications, as well as APIs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Data Processing:</b> <br /> JSON is better for converting data in
            different programming languages.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Data Sharing:</b> <br /> JSON's structured format makes it easier
            to share and exchange data between different systems and platforms.
